# Credit-Card-Analysis

## Currently an on going project to understand where my money goes. 

``` Why am I doing this even though my bannking apps provides me with a pie chart ? ```

1. Quest to find other interesting metrics and interesting questions which the pie does not give
2. Analyze spend behaviour and understand where we I can cut down and see my own expenses
3.Most importantly, it is fun and a nice learning experience. What better way to work on something of your own and with your data to understand more about yourself?

``` Part 1 ```


<li> The first part deal with cleaning our credit card data and extracting useful features</li>


``` Part 2 ```

<li> The second part deals with creating visualizations and answering few questions about money</li>

``` Part 3 ```

<li> Attempt to forecast our monthly spendings </li>
